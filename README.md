# Identifying potential drug candidate for Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase through Machine Learning with Chembl Database

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Drug databases store huge amounts of open-source data, occasionally selected by scientists to benefit the community. One of the databases is Chembl, which is a meticulously managed collection of bioactive compounds exhibiting drug-like characteristics. In this study, inspired by Data Professor, I am focusing on the enzyme "Human DiHydroOrotate DeHydrogenase" to identify compounds that have inhibitory properties against it.
